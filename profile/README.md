# NSSNU — Nowhere State Surreal Neko University 
> ***“Where every cat finds its sunbeam.”***

Welcome to NSSNU, the world’s first fully accredited* (by who? don’t ask) multidisciplinary institution dedicated to empowering cats in every field — from cybersecurity to cinema, from drama to data science.

NSSNU blends structured scholarship with an ethereal creative atmosphere.
Rooted in curiosity, comfort, and quiet brilliance, the university is dedicated to exploring every field where imagination and intellect intersect.
Its foundations feel real; its spirit feels like a dream.

If a profession exists, we have a cat for it. <br>
If a vibe exists, we’ve already matched it to a faculty. <br>
If a sunbeam exists, a cat is already sleeping on it. <br>
Research happens in sunlit corners. <br>
Innovation begins in quiet storms. <br>
Every project aims to be both functional and softly surreal.

## About NSSNU

NSSNU is a long-established (founded when i needed to finish my assignment on bootstrap) academic institution focused on creativity, innovation, and unapologetically cozy chaos. <br>
We believe knowledge should be warm, welcoming, slightly sparkly, and occasionally covered in cat fur. <br>
Our university is built on three core pillars:
1. **Curiosity** — If the cat asks “why,” we investigate.
2. **Comfort** — Research is conducted only in optimal sunlight zones.
3. **Competence** — Just because it’s silly doesn’t mean it’s not serious.

> The university exists at the intersection of realism and reverie: grounded enough to be believable, yet infused with an underlying sense of wonder.

## Departments at NSSNU

Yes, we have real departments. Yes, each one has a cat dean. <br>
No, this is not a joke. (It is absolutely a joke.)

### ✿ Department of Cybersecurity

Cats trained in ethical hacking, password sniffing, and “accidentally” knocking over suspicious USB drives. Focused on technology, security, artificial intelligence, and computational creativity. Students learn to defend networks while napping in the sun.

### ✿ Department of Drama & Performing Arts

Emotional, dramatic, theatrical cats who meow like they’re in a telenovela. Dedicated to performance, visual expression, narrative design, and cultural studies. (Admissions may require one dramatic faint on a carpet.)

### ✿ Department of Makeup & Aesthetics

Where glam meets claws. Beauty-guru cats teach contouring, color theory, and eyeliner sharper than their claws. Focused on visual aesthetics, artistic expression, and self-presentation across mediums.

### ✿ Department of Cinema & Digital Arts

Filmmaker cats who know exactly how to block the camera. Study cinematography, storyboard creation, editing, and immersive visual storytelling. Students often accidentally star in their own productions.

### ✿ Department of Computer Science

Coders who vibe in pink, lavender, and late-night debugging storms. Focused on software development, algorithms, and computational thinking. Finals may involve literally chasing bugs.

### ✿ Department of Sciences

Exploring Biology, Chemistry, Physics, and the eternal mystery of the moving laser dot. Students conduct experiments in sunlit corners, storms permitted but optional.

### ✿ School of Cozy Environmental Studies

A holistic program dedicated to rose gardens, stormy skies, and the art of tea. Focused on environmental awareness, comfort-based research, and living in harmony with one’s surroundings.

### ✿ School of Aesthetic & Surreal Studies

Examines atmosphere, dream logic, emotional landscapes, and ethereal design. Students learn to translate feelings into spatial, visual, and conceptual work.

### ✿ School of Professional & Social Disciplines

Covers business, psychology, communication, digital culture, and applied modern studies. Designed for cats and humans alike who operate with equal parts instinct and intentionality.

## Our Mission

To build a creative, academically framed, aesthetically driven digital universe where every discipline can be reimagined through curiosity, atmosphere, and soft surrealism.

## The NSSNU Promise

A real university structure. <br>
An ethereal academic world. <br>
A place where curiosity rests, grows, and eventually finds its sunbeam. <br>
A place where creators can bring to life the ideas that feel too strange, too gentle, or too atmospheric to belong anywhere else.
